# Estimating relative error rates using the 'perfect sample' method

Pipeline for estimating relative error rates using the perfect sample method. It is based on measuring excess of per site divergence between the consensus sequence assumed to be 'perfect' (estimated from a high-dept sample) and an outgroup. It assumes all samples have the same divergence to the outgroup.
