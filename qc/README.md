# Scripts used for quality control

`sites_qc` contains different scritps and pipelines used to idenfity problematic regions of the genome (ie those likely to contain mapping and genotyping errors) which are masked for further analysis.

`individuals_qc` contains scripts used to idenfity problematic individuals (for example samples with excess error rates or duplicates) that are excluded from further analyses.
