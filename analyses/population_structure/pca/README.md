# do pca with genotype likelihoods for common snps

Does PCA using PCAngsd with the gentoype likelihoods estimated in analyses/gentoyping/genotype_likelihoods. 

We tried different values of e, the ones used in the paper are with e=7 (the first run in script). There are also a few commands that explore pcangsd multiple possibilities, on the end we only used for the pca.
