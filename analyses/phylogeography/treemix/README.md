# Run treemix

Pipeline developed by Malthe Sebro Ramsussen to run treemix for low depth data.
It estiamtes population safs files with ANGSD, from which it extracts allele counts as the maximum likelihood count per site. It keeps only sites present in all populations.

We also tested it to detect sites under selection with gross, but did not use that on the end.
